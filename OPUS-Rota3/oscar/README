OSCAR-STAR
README



(1) Installation

    (A) Make sure that all of the files mentioned in section (4) are present.


    (B) Set the environment variable 'MULUL'

            for bash users:
                $> MULUL=<oscar-star-basepath>/library/z/
                $> export MULUL


            for tcsh users:
                $> setenv  MULUL <oscar-star-basepath>/library/z/

                where <oscar-star-basepath> = the absolute path where the oscar-star folder is located
                    Example: /home/oscar-star


            ** note: don't forget the ending '/' character when setting the 'MULUL' variable


    (C) Compile by running 'make'

            $> make


    (D) Verify. The installation is successful if the following files were created:

            library/main.o
            library/side4.o
            oscar-star



(2) Running

    (A) Make sure that the environment variable 'MULUL' is set before running oscar-star.

           Note on setting environment variables:

                Setting the environment variables as mentioned in section (1)(B) will only last for that one terminal session.
                If you want to make it permanent, you need to put the export/setenv commands in your .bashrc or .profile files.


    (B) Run oscar-star

            $> ./oscar-star <pdbfile>

                    Example:
                       $> ./oscar-star example/1noa.pdb


            $> ./oscar-star 

                    A file called 'data' in the running directory contains a list of pdb files.

                    Example:
                        $> example/data



(3) Outputs

    (A) A model pdb file of format <pdbid-base-name>_model.pdb

            Example: 1noa_model.pdb


    (B) A file named 'result' which describes the accuracy of the model.

(5) Notes

    (A) In cases where only a small part of the protein is  modeled, set the 80th column of the 
        pdb file of the non-modeled part to 'X' as follows:

            ATOM      1  N   ALA A   1       7.672 -12.002  34.411                         X

        The polar hydrogen atoms should be added for the non-modeled part before calculation.   

    (B) The upper limit of the size of the  modeled protein is 3000 residues or 30000 atoms.


    (C) The program is free only for academic users.


    (D) When doing fresh installations, make sure that the following files are not present:

            library/main.o
            library/side4.o
