# OPUS-Rota3

Side-chain modeling is critical for protein structure prediction since the uniqueness of the protein structure is largely determined by its side-chain packing conformation. In this paper, differing from most approaches which reply on rotamer library sampling, we first propose a novel side-chain rotamer prediction method based on deep neural networks, named OPUS-RotaNN. Then, on the basis of our previous work OPUS-Rota2, we propose an open-source side-chain modeling framework, OPUS-Rota3, which integrates the results of different methods into its rotamer library as the sampling candidates. By including OPUS-RotaNN into OPUS-Rota3, we conduct our experiments on three native backbone test sets and one non-native backbone test set. On the native backbone test set CAMEO-Hard61 for example, OPUS-Rota3 successfully predicts 51.14% of all side-chain dihedral angles with a tolerance criterion of 20Â°, outperforms OSCAR-star (50.87%), SCWRL4 (50.40%) and FASPR (49.85%). On the non-native backbone test set DB379-ITASSER, the accuracy of OPUS-Rota3 is 52.49%, better than OSCAR-star (48.95%), FASPR (48.69%) and SCWRL4 (48.29%).

## Datasets

### Train & Val:

The training and validation sets for OPUS-RotaNN are the same as that for OPUS-TASS, which are hosted on [Baidu Drive](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1L6w_qBIKvleO2uFr1Ekevw) with password `zmc1`. Also, they can be downloaded directly from [Here](http://ma-lab.rice.edu/MaLab/dist/opus_tass_datasets.zip). More details can be found in [OPUS-TASS](https://github.com/thuxugang/opus_tass) repo.

The CSF120 features for the training and validation sets are hosted on [Baidu Drive](https://pan.baidu.com/s/15pfFzL4kaYdaV8A37BwqPw) with password `7bmi`. Also, they can be downloaded directly from [Here](xxx) (Comeing soon).

### Test2016 & CASP-FM & CAMEO-Hard61

The pdb files of these three sets are hosted on [Baidu Drive](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1mwsG6OeuOwzmHsWkN1EAJQ) with password `em4s`. Also, they can be downloaded directly from [Here](xxx) (Comeing soon).

### DB379 & DB379-ITASSER:

These two sets can be downloaded from FASPR paper.

## OPUS-RotaNN

### Dependency

```
Python 3.7
TensorFlow v2.0
xssp-3.0.10
```

The standalone version of OPUS-RotaNN (including training & inference codes) is hosted on [Baidu Drive](https://pan.baidu.com/s/11UO508bMR9rOfUYLBA_2fA) with password `3l8k`. Also, it can be downloaded directly from [Here](xxx) (Comeing soon).

Note that for higher speed, we simply the calculation in xssp source code. The pipeline for recompiling the xssp is as following:

```
cd mkdssp
tar zxvf xssp-3.0.10.tar.gz
cp dssp.cpp xssp-3.0.10/src/
cd xssp-3.0.10/
./autogen.sh
./configure
make mkdssp
```
